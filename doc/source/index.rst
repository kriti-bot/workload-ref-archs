Workload Reference Architecture for OpenStack
=============================================

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack Enterprise Work Group is developing a series of 'tenant-level'
reference architectures to help users to learn and understand how to deploy
different types of workloads on an OpenStack Cloud. These reference
architectures describe the list of OpenStack services that can be used to
support the various workloads and provide sample code to bootstrap the workload
environment on an OpenStack Cloud.
